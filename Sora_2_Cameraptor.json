The setting is future Moscow, 100 years after humanity was saved, as a second alien invasion has just begun. In the sky, two warring spaceships dogfight above a multi-level skyway against a colossal sunset. Below, a buoyant, human-height chase camera pursues a battered, rusted, retro-futuristic DeLorean-style car with a roof-mounted railgun as it executes a high-speed, controlled drift.\nKey Moments (Shot Sequence):\nThe Reveal: The camera pulls back sharply to reveal it is mounted on the spine of Rrglor—a giant cybernetic velociraptor. He sprints on all fours, steam venting from his chrome plates. Rrglor turns his head, looks directly into the camera (at the audience), bares his teeth in a cocky grin, winks, and then surges forward with renewed speed.\nCombat and Transformation: A slug from the railgun tears past with a deafening boom. Rrglor jukes sideways, dodging the shot. Simultaneously, the rig on his spine begins a complex mechanical transformation: the camera folds in half, rotates on its axis, and morphs into a futuristic plasma cannon glowing with neon energy.\nThe Takedown (Side-Scroller View): The perspective snaps to a 2D platformer-style side view. Rrglor and the car race in parallel. Rrglor fires the plasma cannon, and a massive blast obliterates the DeLorean's trunk, sending a comical bobblehead flying out as debris. The car loses control, smashes through the bridge's guardrail, and plummets into the abyss below, erupting in a fiery explosion.\nThe Heroic Finale: Without slowing down, Rrglor reaches a massive gap in the broken bridge. He makes a spectacular, breathtaking leap across the chasm. Time warps into super slow-motion, freezing him mid-air in a dramatic pose against the backdrop of the neon-scarred, semi-destroyed city. In the sky above, the battling spaceships are also frozen in time. At this moment, a stylish, animated title card smacks onto the screen: CAMERAPTOR.\nAI Directives (Cinematography & Style)\nCinematography: The chase is shot with a kinetic, human-height camera featuring punchy whip-pans and snappy rack-focus. Insert side-on, video-game-style shots for the firefight moments. The final jump is a heroic, super slow-motion freeze-frame. Use a 32mm lens for the dynamic chase and a 50mm lens for close-ups of Rrglor. Employ a shallow depth of field (DOF) on impact beats.\nLighting: Volumetric sunset with long, amber beams as the key light. A cool indigo glow from the city as the fill light. Bright cyan flashes from the plasma and railgun muzzle flares. Practical lighting from damaged, unreadable neon signs. A light haze is present to create atmospheric depth.\nMood: Colorful, irreverent, heroic, and cheeky. A big-hearted space-opera swagger.\nColor Palette: Magenta, teal, amber, indigo, cyan.\nSound Design: An upbeat retro pop-rock needle-drop for the soundtrack. Ambient sounds include wind shear over the skyway, tire screams, the thump of the railgun, the hiss of plasma, and crumbling concrete. A powerful, crowd-pleasing audio sting hits with the final title card.\nDialogue (Optional):\nVoiceover (dry, upbeat): \"One hundred years after we saved the world... turns out the warranty expired.\"\nRrglor (grinning at the camera): \"Bite down, bad guys.\"","D:\\Users\\ASUS\\Downloads","Sora_Video","Sora 2 (720p)","Landscape","12","",15,1200,true]}],"links":[[11,9,3,3,0,"STRING"],[14,9,0,1,0,"IMAGE"],[15,9,1,1,1,"AUDIO"],[18,11,0,9,0,"IMAGE"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":0.8847648264333651,"offset":[1391.9755059016634,-3629.9875242894573]},"frontendVersion":"1.18.1","ue_links":[]},"version":0.4}
